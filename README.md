# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: Begin by setting up your hardware (e.g., PC) and necessary software, such as Anaconda with Python 3.7 or a code runner environment
### Step 2: Import necessary libraries like NumPy.
### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: Output the result—the rank of the matrix.
## Program:
```

import numpy as np

A = np.array([[5, -3, -10],
              [2, 2, -3],
              [-3, -1, 5]])

soln = np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
print(soln)

```
## Output:
